# Ignore built output folders. Edit this list: list the the top-level folders
# that you have in your `src` folder. Maintaining this is a tradeoff to the
# flexibility we get from the way we're publish packages so that they work in
# as many places as possible. If you don't edit this list, then your build
# files will be listed when you run `git status`. Optionally, you might like to
# just check those files into git. It's up to you.
